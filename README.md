# restaurant-site

This is our first HTML and CSS Exercise for our Front End Development Class. 

Our second HTML and CSS Exercise is to add to our base static page with a product page and checkout page.

We have added a bootstrap branch of the code. We have added both the bootstrap library and animate.css into the restaurant-site.
